### notes ###
Unicode - old was 8 bit char ascii
C# auto unicode - 16 bit.
'd''e''l''i''m''i''t''e' chars
"delimite strings"
method is action or behavior
for iterating through string via char. can use foreach, then doing have to do do for loop with string.Length
gets called on data type, not the c etc
if (char.IsPunctuation(c))
Math.Pow(); // is different

random gen = new Random();
gen.Next(0, 15);
static methods hmm
diff method vs function?

c# string is immutable can't change string once created.
concatination doesnt change it creates a completely new string with added char.
Lookup each new datatype property, methods.
Ahh static method means datatype.whatever(char c); vs c.dostuff(); ?
static usually means doesnt change though like static variable in a function if it's called again.. same value is in it. ???
